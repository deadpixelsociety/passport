Usage
-----
#### Create Rules
Use the existing DSL rules or create custom rules to fit your needs. Capture the returned Passport 
object to invoke validation when required.
````
passport {
    rules<String>(phoneEdit) {
        numeric(getString(R.string.valid_phone_required))
    }
    
    rules<String>(emailLayout) {
        email()
        length(8, 32)
    }
    
    rules<Boolean>(switchView) {
        rule({ it }, { "The switch must be on." })
    }
}
````

You can also use the property delegate ``validator`` to setup your Passport object.
````
val validationRules by validator {
    rules<String>(phoneEdit) {
        numeric(getString(R.string.valid_phone_required))
    }
    
    rules<String>(emailLayout) {
        email()
        length(8, 32)
    }
    
    rules<Boolean>(switchView) {
        rule({ it }, { "The switch must be on." })
    }
}
````

#### Validate
A specific view, view group, fragment or activity can be targeted for validation.
````
val validator = passport { <snip> }
if(validator.validate(this, ValidationMethod.IMMEDIATE)) {
    // Valid!
}
````
Validation supports batch, fail fast, and immediate modes:
* Batch - All views and rules are processed before validation is complete.
* Fail Fast - All views are processed. For each view all rules are processed until the first failure 
is encountered.
* Immediate - All views and rules are processed until a failure is found and validation completes 
immediately.

#### Validator Factories
Validators are provided to passport via validator factory functions.
````
Passport.validatorFactory({ TextViewValidator() })
````
Passport will assign the correct validator to a view during rule assignment based on it's class 
type. A specific validator can be assigned instead if desired. 

#### Custom Validators
Custom validators allow for any view type to be managed. See the [SwitchCompat example](https://github.com/deadpixelsociety/passport/blob/master/example/src/main/kotlin/com/thedeadpixelsociety/passport/example/SwitchCompatValidator.kt).

See the [example activity](https://github.com/deadpixelsociety/passport/blob/master/example/src/main/kotlin/com/thedeadpixelsociety/passport/example/MainActivity.kt).

#### Gradle
````
allprojects {
	repositories {
		...
		maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
	}
}

dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.deadpixelsociety.passport:core:2.1.1'
    // 'design' includes a validator for the TextInputLayout view in the design support library.
